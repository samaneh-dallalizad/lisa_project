## Overview
With this API, a user can:
* add and retrieve dishes and types from the database,
* add dishes to the menu for a specific date,
* retrieve all dishes from the menu for that date,
* delete dishes for a specific date.

## Installation

To run the server locally, you need to start a Postgres container with the following command:
```

  postgres
  ```

Then:
* git clone 
* npm install

There is no authentication on this API - all functions available to all users.
